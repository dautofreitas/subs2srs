Subs Re-Timer Release Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Subs Re-Timer?
----------------------
Use this tool to re-time a subtitle file based on the timings of another subtitle
file. This is helpful when one is already synced to a video but the other is not.

Note:
  This is not a general subtitle timing tool like Aegisub and cannot be used
  to create subtitles from scratch. It is useful in the very specific case
  where you already have a subtitle file that is timed to a video and you
  want to match another subtitle file's timings to it.


How to Launch:
--------------
1) Make sure that you have .Net Framework Version 3.5 installed (you probably
   already do). If not, you can get it through Windows update or via the following
   link: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=21

2) Simply double-click SubsReTimer.exe to launch Subs Re-Timer.

    <p>
      Use this tool to re-time a subtitle file based on the timings of another subtitle file. This is helpful when one is already synced to a video but the other is not.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Note: This is not a general subtitle timing tool like Aegisub and cannot be used to create subtitles from scratch. It is  useful in the very specific case where you already have a subtitle file that is timed to a video and you want to match another subtitle file's timings to it.

    <h2><a name="how_to_use"></a>General Usage</h2>
      
    <p>
      To begin, drag a .srt or .ass subtitle file into the left or right subtitle box or use the use the 'File | Open Left/Right...' menu options.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The left subtitle box should contain the subtitle file that is already timed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The right subtitle box should contain the subtitle file that needs to be re-timed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Subs Re-Timer has only one operation: Time Shift. To shift timings, select a line in the right subtitle box and it's corresponding line in the left subtitle box. Now press the "Time Shift" button. This will shift all subtitle timings in the right subtitle box from the selected line onwards by the time difference between the selected line in the left subtitle box and the selected line in the right subtitle box.
    </p> 
    
    <p>
      Lines of dialog right after a large time gap (28 seconds) are colored orange. These gaps usually represent opening/ending credits or commercials that were subbed in one file but not the other. The timings for these lines (and everything below) usually need to be shifted.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Always go from top to bottom. Usually, time shifting only needs to be performed on orange lines. Typically, 1-4 time shifts will be necassary for the two subtiles to match one another. 
    </p>

    <h2><a name="tutorial"></a>Tutorial</h2>
    
    <p>
      Navigate to the "Tutorial_Files" folder in the Subs Re-Timer directory. Here we see 2 files. "Tutorial_LS03_Jap.ass" contains Japanese subtitles and is the file that is timed to the video. "Tutorial_LS03_Eng.srt" contains English subtitles and is the file that we want to re-time.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Drag "Tutorial_LS03_Jap.ass" to the left subtitle box. The left subtitle box should always contain the subtitles that are already timed. 
    </p>
    
    <p>     
      Drag "Tutorial_LS03_Eng.ass" to the right subtitle box. The right subtitle box should always contain the subtitles need to be re-timed. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      At this point, the interface should look like this:
    <p>

    <img src="Images/Main.png" alt="" />
    
    <p>
      As you can see in the chart at the bottom, the first 4 lines match each other pretty well. However, the 5th line doesn't match at all. This is evident by the gray coloring of the lines in the right subtitle box. The gray lines indicate that the timings do not seem to match any of the timings in the left subtitle box. It would appear that the Japanese version doesn't include subtitles for the opening music but the English subtitles do.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The orange line in the left subtitle box indicates that there exists a large timing gap (at least 28 seconds) between orange line and the previous line. Orange lines are usually the only ones that need our attention. In this example, there is only a single orange line and it is right in our view. Other subtitles may have many orange lines and they may be further down in the file. In these cases you can manually scroll down and look for them or you may double-click a line or press Ctrl-Down to automatically move to the next orange line.
    </p> 
    
    <p>
      Go ahead and right-click (not left-click) the orange line. Right-clicking will both select the line that was clicked and also select the closest timed line in the other subtitle box.
    </p>
   
    <img src="Images/Tut1.png" alt="" />
    
    <p>
      The two selected lines in the above screenshot do not match. Find and left-click the matching line in the right subtitle box at 0:01:31.08 as shown here:
    </p>
        
    <img src="Images/Tut2.png" alt="" />
    
    <p>
      We will now shift all subtitle timings in the right subtitle box from the selected line onwards by the time difference between the selected line in the left subtitle box and the selected line in the right subtitle box. Do this now by pressing the "Time Shift" button or Middle-clicking or pressing Enter. The result:
    </p>
    
    <img src="Images/Tut3.png" alt="" />
    
    <p>
      In the above screenshot, notice that both lines in the bottom chart now start at the same time. Also notice that the "Average Mismatch" statistic in the top-left went from "2.356 : 0.722" to "1.874 : 0.272". The "1.874" represents the average mismatch of all lines (in seconds) and the "0.272" is the average mismatch of only the non-gray lines (in seconds). The first number is pretty high because these 2 subtitle files have a different number of lines. In the top-middle, you can see that the left file has 505 total lines whereas the right file has 535 total lines.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The next screenshot shows another example of a gray line (notice how the 「は！？」 in the Japanese version was not translated in the English version):
    </p>
        
    <img src="Images/Tut4.png" alt="" />
    
    <p>
      Is it helpful to spot check the timings near the middle and end. The next screenshot shows that the timings still match up pretty well at the end:
    </p>
    
    <img src="Images/Tut5.png" alt="" />
    
    <p>
      We can see that the final line still has a 94% overlap which is probably acceptable for watching and more than acceptable for use with subs2srs. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You can go ahead and save the file now. You're done.

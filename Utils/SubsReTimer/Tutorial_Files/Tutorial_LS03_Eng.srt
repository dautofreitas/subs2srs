1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,500
Okay, let's do this!

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,500
Let's go!

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,100
Grr!

4
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,730
Quit screwing around and start!

5
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,070
The ambiguous 3cm?
Does that mean it's plushy? Wait!

6
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,410
The wrapping is a uniform, argh,
it's not an act, pooh

7
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:13,940
Gotta do your best, gotta just do it

8
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,610
That's time to catch 'n' release, eek

9
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,880
Between sweat (whoop)
sweat (whoop)

10
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,850
Darlin', darlin', freeze!

11
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,650
Kinda lethargic,
something's kinda comin' out

12
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,620
I love you... Oh wait,
one of those was different

13
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,020
Worrywarts, high metal bars

14
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,660
Tasty thoughts... And that's enough!

15
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,430
The heated body of that
flying you-know-who

16
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,030
It's what you call a normal girlie

17
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,900
Am I the only one surprised?

18
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,460
Seconds on pork-bone broth ramen
with wire-hard noodles

19
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,400
Da da da da da

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,440
Pom-poms cheer squad

21
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,970
Let's get cherry pie

22
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,640
Happy fun welcoming party

23
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,180
Look up! Sensation

24
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,210
Yeah! Feeling of existence,
dot dot small planet

25
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,980
Collided and it melted away,
in total awe

26
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,580
Go all out to sing, shi-ranger!

27
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,920
Take it away!

28
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,220
I should be the one who'll be
laughing in the end

29
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:10,430
Because I have the sailor suit
<- This is my conclusion

30
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,400
It's only Monday!

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,000
Already in a bad mood? What to do?

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,940
I really prefer the summer outfits
<- kya! wah! good! (cute!) <3

33
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,010
Until we approach 3 pixels,
no hesitations please *

34
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,610
Do your best, be energetic

35
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:29,980
My darlin', darlin' please!

36
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,450
Come to think of it, we're wearing
the summer uniforms starting today.

37
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,290
I bet Konata will still come
in the winter uniform.

38
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,550
There's always at least one person
in every class that forgets.

39
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,020
Morning, Sis!

40
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,460
Wow, there was someone
so close to me.

41
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:58,640
Oh, no, I forgot to apply for
the giveaway in The Tele!

42
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,350
Darn, I was kinda going after
that apron from Love Apron...

43
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,320
You just didn't have enough love.

44
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,790
You didn't have enough love,
Kagami, so you forgot.

45
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,320
Well, I was really busy lately

46
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,560
with the committee stuff
and studying for exams...

47
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,360
No, no, those are only excuses.

48
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,230
I've never forgotten, not even once!

49
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,200
Don't compare me to you!
You only think of playing around!

50
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,040
Or rather, how you phrased it
just now is really irritating.

51
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,610
How do you win those
giveaways, anyway?

52
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,070
In one word: Love!

53
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,580
Fine, I'm a woman with no love!

54
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,380
Well, if you send in a normal postcard,

55
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,150
you'll lose where you otherwise
stood a chance of winning.

56
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,820
How do you write your
postcards, Kona-chan?

57
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,720
Oh, I make them to win, of course!

58
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,090
How?

59
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,460
Neat handwriting is the
most basic of fundamentals.

60
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,220
You have to write a postcard
that the choosers

61
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,830
would just want to
get into their hands.

62
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:48,800
For example?

63
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,800
For example, use a highlighter to
draw a border on the postcard.

64
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,370
Oh, that really shows up well.

65
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,540
Furthermore, you add an illustration,

66
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,310
with a motif of the item
that you want to get.

67
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,800
An illustration?

68
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,040
I don't think I can draw very well.

69
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,070
People of that sort resort to numbers,
and send in many cards.

70
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,080
I think I can do that.

71
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,350
However, even when
you're submitting a lot,

72
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,790
don't use a printer.

73
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:20,130
You have to make sure to write
each and every one by hand.

74
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,060
And send a hundred at once.

75
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,130
A hundred?!

76
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,160
A hundred is like normal.

77
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,730
That costs a fortune!

78
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,100
It's so that you can
get what you want.

79
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,500
You need both enthusiasm
and investment.

80
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,440
But isn't there a time when
it's cheaper to just buy it?

81
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,570
There are things in this world
that money can't buy.

82
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,580
A hundred postcards...
Do they fit in a mailbox?

83
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,220
You don't put them in all at once,

84
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,850
but you send them in small portions,
a few at a time.

85
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,580
And you have to spread it
over several days.

86
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,490
When you have a lot of cards at once,

87
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,190
the chooser might
shove all of them aside.

88
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,330
Well, there are times when it's best
to not be so desperate,

89
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,200
and times when the opposite is true.

90
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,600
Then what should I do?

91
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,170
That's why it's all about love!

92
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,200
Whatever...

93
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,140
In any case, if you want
to win something,

94
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,140
check out free handouts or flyers
folded into newspapers as well,

95
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,210
and apply for something that
doesn't look too popular.

96
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,280
Chances of winning
are pretty high then.

97
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,920
Yeah, I'll try that.

98
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,410
Where's the love in that?

99
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,290
Kagami, Tsukasa... You sure
don't look alike, for being twins.

100
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,830
Oh, we're fraternal twins.

101
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,800
So the difference is more
like ordinary sisters.

102
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,230
Identical twins come from one egg
and really do look alike,

103
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,540
but fraternal twins can be different
in appearance and personality.

104
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,910
I see.

105
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:42,170
It's true that Tsukasa is so laid-back,
but Kagami is vicious.

106
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:42,510
- What was that?!

107
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,280
- Oh, how scary.
- What was that?!

108
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:43,680
- Oh, how scary.

109
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,880
Maybe if we set your hairdo
and ribbons in the same way,

110
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,280
you might look more alike
than we think.

111
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,410
Kona-chan!

112
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,920
No good, it's impossible to put
something cute on you, Kagami.

113
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,850
Shut up! Don't go imagining
something on your own

114
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,690
and saying something rude from it!

115
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,250
Do you have something
like telepathy?

116
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,830
You know, how twins can be far apart,

117
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,330
but somehow they have
the same lifestyle habits

118
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,600
or same taste in the opposite gender,

119
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,970
and even marry other twins and stuff.

120
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,240
That, and like when one is in danger,

121
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,310
the other can sense it from
somewhere completely different.

122
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,440
There are all sorts of strange
phenomenon out there.

123
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,550
So you have telepathy
or something, right?

124
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,250
How about you try it out right now.
Like, beep-beep-beep.

125
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,520
That's just you reading
too much manga.

126
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,220
Mana-Kana, too...

127
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,350
Mana-Kana?

128
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,460
Both of them were saying how
they were slightly different.

129
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,220
Like how Mana's the one
who's really cautious,

130
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,730
and Kana's the one who's optimistic.

131
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:37,260
And they said their voices were
slightly different when they sing.

132
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,260
That reminds me,

133
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:42,470
Mana-Kana had always thought
that they were fraternal twins,

134
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,530
but they recently found out that
they actually were identical.

135
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,370
Really?

136
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,210
But is that something to be
so surprised about?

137
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:53,380
The definition of identical and
fraternal twins changed recently.

138
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,350
That means there's
the possibility that you two

139
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,250
are identical twins as well,
Kagami, Tsukasa...

140
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,310
The similarities between you two...

141
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,690
Both of you like sweets, right?

142
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,290
Yeah, I love them.

143
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,020
Sort of.

144
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,690
Both of you are left-handed.

145
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:07,360
- Yeah.

146
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:07,690
- That's right.
- Yeah.

147
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:08,460
- That's right.

148
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,730
What's your favorite color?

149
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,630
White, I guess.

150
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,360
- Black.

151
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:11,630
- The same colors as your souls.
- Black.

152
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,230
- The same colors as your souls.

153
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,530
What was that?!

154
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,310
You know, with all this talk of eggs
and sausage, I'm getting hungry.

155
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,970
We weren't talking about food.

156
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,240
It's so muggy.

157
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,990
We end up sweating as soon
as it gets a little crowded.

158
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,260
It's getting to be
that time of the year.

159
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,990
It's hot!

160
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,220
They haven't turned on
the air conditioning yet.

161
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,400
Hold on!

162
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,740
It's hot!

163
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,040
Dear Soujirou and Konata Izumi,
We have not nurtured our love for so long,
but we, Kiyotaka Narumi and Yui Kobayakawa,
are getting married this coming XXth of June.

164
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,310
Dear Soujirou and Konata Izumi,
We have not nurtured our love for so long,
but we, Kiyotaka Narumi and Yui Kobayakawa,
are getting married this coming XXth of June.
The ladybug samba, punk version...

165
00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:00,280
One of my relatives is
getting married this month.

166
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,020
Wow, a June Bride! That's so nice!

167
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,550
Why is such a wet,

168
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:10,590
gloomy season
the forerunner of happiness?

169
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,060
Um...

170
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,460
Why is it joyful to
get married in June?

171
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,330
Yeah.

172
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,700
They say that the term June

173
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:24,040
originates from the goddess
Juno in Roman mythology.

174
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,340
Juno is known as Hera
in Greek mythology,

175
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,980
and oversees marriages
and childbirth.

176
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:33,880
So, they say that those that
get married in the month of Hera,

177
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,610
namely June, are protected
and blessed by the goddess.

178
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,350
But Hera is Zeus's wife, right?

179
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,890
Yes, that's right.

180
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,960
I have an image of Hera
being a very jealous woman,

181
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,820
so to me, it doesn't feel really happy.

182
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,470
In a wedding, which would you like
to wear, a dress, or a kimono?

183
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,600
I would like to wear a dress.

184
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,400
It's what I've been dreaming of
ever since I was little.

185
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,440
I would have to say a dress as well...

186
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,740
But a kimono is nice too, after all...

187
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,910
I think I'd like to wear both.

188
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,150
I hear that as of late,
there are miniskirt versions,

189
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,120
and all sorts of colorful
wedding dresses.

190
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,790
I see... Miniskirt wedding dresses...

191
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:16,420
If it has a very frilly-edged design,
that might be really cute.

192
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,030
"I have many dreams,
I want a lot of frills," you know?

193
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,130
Tsukasa is like Angel Salvia.

194
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:25,500
No, from your hairdo
you're more like Daisy.

195
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,660
So the top should be yellow,
and the skirt should be a miniskirt!

196
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,640
Tsukasa-san would look good
in a miniskirt.

197
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,710
You think so?

198
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,910
The outfit is important,

199
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,740
but what kind of person
you marry is also important.

200
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,050
A childhood friend,
or a girl from a rich family.

201
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,050
It's hard to decide on which one.

202
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,050
On one end, you have a huge dowry.

203
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:48,920
You can use magic like
Beho#mi or l#nazun.

204
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,190
But, feeling-wise...

205
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,960
Bianca, no doubt about it.

206
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,660
Hey, Kagami, you're much
more pure than I thought.

207
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,730
I thought you'd run for
the girl with the money.

208
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,420
You didn't have a comeback ready?

209
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,530
S'up, Konata.

210
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:06,740
There was a place I didn't get in
that game I borrowed the other day.

211
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,830
Whoa, wait a minute, Kagamin.

212
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,840
Isn't it fun because you solve
things like that on your own?

213
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,650
You have a point.

214
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:15,550
Yup, yup.

215
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,720
In other words, you understand
the meaning of doing things yourself,

216
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,550
so you'll now do all your own
homework, right, Konata?

217
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,520
Detectives in manga and drama shows

218
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,690
keep running into murders,
for some strange reason.

219
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,630
Like Conan and Kindaichi.

220
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,500
If they didn't, the story
wouldn't go anywhere, right?

221
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,500
You think so? I think
normal cases would work too.

222
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,540
Normal?

223
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,060
Like running all over Japan
in search of a missing person.

224
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,480
I think following someone has
a highly game-like aspect.

225
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,650
It has thrill, and suspense.

226
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,750
Well, yeah...

227
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,450
Like accepting a request
from a husband to check out

228
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,220
whether or not his wife
is having an affair.

229
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,050
Or looking for lost pets?

230
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,520
Yeah, that's it.

231
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,090
But would you enjoy watching
something like that?

232
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,660
No, most likely it wouldn't be
any fun at all.

233
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,490
See?

234
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,060
That, and cases that happen in reality

235
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:07,970
usually don't use clever tricks
like those in manga or TV.

236
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:10,170
It's true that they don't.

237
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,570
Like faking a fingerprint,
or fabricating something,

238
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,060
or eliminating Luminol responses...

239
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,140
Like spoofing even the
forensic investigation team.

240
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,610
Well, those that are really tough
get copycat criminals,

241
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,620
so there's probably
some media censorship.

242
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,780
Oh, that...

243
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,750
Those perfect crimes end
without the public knowing,

244
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,650
or remain unsolved, huh...

245
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:31,120
That's a risky line, in all sorts of ways.

246
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,030
Don't you hate how there's
so much rain lately?

247
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,020
You're right.

248
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,000
I used to like the rain
when I was little, too...

249
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,900
Rain gets you wet,
and your laundry can't get dry,

250
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,530
so I never really liked it.

251
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,280
Kona-chan, why did
you like it so much?

252
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,210
Because rain would cancel
the baseball broadcasts,

253
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,210
so I could watch my anime
like I normally do.

254
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:58,280
I see. That's really like you
to say that, Kona-chan.

255
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,910
But nowadays, there are
so many domed stadiums...

256
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,610
Lucky Star!

257
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,260
What's wrong?

258
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,600
Often in manga, you have
really stupid characters

259
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,530
and really smart characters
attending the same school.

260
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,970
That's enough outta you!

261
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,000
Shut up! Gourds at the top
of the vine should stay out!

262
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,540
When you think about it,
it's really strange.

263
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,040
When you talk about that,
I just saw this anime recently,

264
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,610
where the teacher and
the students are the same age,

265
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,150
no matter how you thought about it.

266
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,810
Or rather, the teacher
actually looked younger!

267
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:29,880
Ma'am...

268
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,680
What is it, Miss Ta_____ana?

269
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,220
It's a well-known fact that
no matter who you are,

270
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,620
people like to see the gap between
actual age and physical age.

271
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,590
I don't get it.

272
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:42,230
You shouldn't doubt it.

273
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,200
Or rather, it's all the more
strange to have students

274
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,320
with different school scores
in the same class!

275
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,960
You're right. I really have
to agree on that part.

276
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,210
I hate to say this, but I'm surprised

277
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:56,980
that you actually got accepted
to this school, Konata.

278
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,740
You're good at cramming,

279
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,710
so maybe you did the same
for your entrance exam?

280
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,750
What? Is that really the case?

281
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,120
Well, it took more than
one night of studying.

282
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,690
You surprised me!

283
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,190
But I'm surprised that you
were able to keep studying.

284
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:18,130
Is there an entrance exam prep
game for the DS or something?

285
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,830
Dad gave me a couple conditions.

286
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,170
Like, a Pippin for a rank D school,

287
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,840
a 3DO for a rank C school,

288
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,840
and a PS2 for a rank B school.

289
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,240
Izumi's dad really knows how
to control his daughter.

290
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,130
I had a thought.

291
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,320
I'm even more surprised that
Tsukasa got into our school.

292
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,750
Shouldn't it have been a little harder
for you to say that?!

293
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,190
- All right! I won again!

294
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,760
- Damn, I can't win
if it's a fighting game.
- All right! I won again!

295
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,730
- Damn, I can't win
if it's a fighting game.

296
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,160
She's put too much time into them.

297
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,330
You can try me at anything,
even if it's not a fighting game.

298
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,730
Oh, is that right?

299
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,400
Then, next up...

300
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,770
I challenge you to a quiz game!

301
00:12:58,770 --> 00:12:59,640
You're kidding!

302
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,440
I lost against Konata
in a game of wits?!

303
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,600
I can't believe this...

304
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,780
Can it be... that she memorized
the question patterns?

305
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,650
When it comes to games,
her memory's always top-notch!

306
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,380
What shall we play next?

307
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,850
Don't rummage through
stuff without asking.

308
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,290
Huh? That's strange...

309
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,660
You used to have a really
easy party game, right?

310
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,760
Why do you know which
games someone has?

311
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,790
That was something that even you
would be able to win, Kagami.

312
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,130
It was so smelly...

313
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:31,740
Kagami, you haven't eaten
any sweets for a while now.

314
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,710
You usually eat so much.

315
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,270
There's no real reason.

316
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:38,880
Oh, I get it! You're dieting
to get ready for the summer?

317
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,880
It's nothing like that.

318
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,080
You don't even have someone
to show off your bathing suit to!

319
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,080
Shut up! You don't need to go there!

320
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,890
By the way, you two were born
on the Star Festival day, right?

321
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,720
It's almost your birthday now.

322
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,720
Yeah, so?

323
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,050
Kona-chan, you remembered!

324
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,330
Seventeen years old, huh...

325
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,460
Seventeen is the year
before the unlucky year.

326
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,260
What happens in the year
before your unlucky year?

327
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,730
It's the year where unlucky
things start to happen,

328
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,800
right before your true unlucky year.

329
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,840
I see.

330
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,940
As my birthday gets closer and
closer, I get more uncertain,

331
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,110
so I ended up buying all sorts
of goods to ward off evil,

332
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,410
and power stones, and stuff like that.

333
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,250
That kinda sounds like fun.

334
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,180
Right. As I kept buying,
it kinda became...

335
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,820
Or rather, we have that
Alert Misfortune charm...

336
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,860
Oh, wait, it was the
Avoid Misfortune charm.

337
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,890
Alert misfortune, huh...

338
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:27,160
Like, "That's enough.
Safe childbirth, safe driving,

339
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,800
let's look all over all of it," and stuff?

340
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,960
Whatever...

341
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,160
Oh, that's right.

342
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,730
Did you know that your birthdays
are on Ponytail Day?

343
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,440
No, I didn't know that.

344
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,870
But why is it July 7?

345
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,880
It's said that Orihime in the
Star Festival legend had a ponytail.

346
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,880
That's really farfetched...

347
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,180
There really is a Japan
Ponytail Association,

348
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,850
and they give out the Japan
Ponytail Awards every year

349
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,750
to a celebrity that looks
good in a pontytail.

350
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,890
Oh, is that so?

351
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:00,360
But I think anyone would
look good in a ponytail.

352
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,880
I wonder.

353
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,940
I have the shortest hair,
so it's really cutting it close.

354
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,110
But a small ponytail looks cute.

355
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,940
Kona-chan, you look good too.

356
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,780
I think you'd be okay like that
in everyday life.

357
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,050
You think so?

358
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,770
Yeah, I think so.

359
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,890
You too, Sis...

360
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:29,820
Kagami, you're...

361
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,530
It's okay. Fine.
I should just take it off.

362
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:34,990
You look so manly, like a samurai.

363
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,480
Well, excuse me!

364
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,570
You know how drunks usually wrap
their neckties around their head?

365
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,500
Is there any meaning behind that?

366
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,940
Oh, that?

367
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,340
Isn't that like when
they loosen their ties,

368
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,310
and it got stuck while they were
trying to pull it off their heads?

369
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,440
I see.

370
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,880
If you're going to say that,
I think people

371
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,950
who always carry takeout boxes
are more unnatural.

372
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,080
Takeout boxes?

373
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,780
Those boxes that Kato-chan
carries in the Drifters shows.

374
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,850
I don't think I get it.

375
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:06,360
Even now, the image of a drunk guy
is always with a tie around his head

376
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,530
and carrying a takeout box.
I don't know why...

377
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,600
Me neither!

378
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,570
I hope Orihime and Hikoboshi
can see each other this year...

379
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,440
Twinkle, twinkle...

380
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,270
And I hope that Alert Misfortune
charm will have good results.

381
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,800
That's a needless worry.

382
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,080
Right now the Comp-Fest is in the
middle of a QUO-card giveaway.

383
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,110
Come to think of it, you
always collect QUO-cards,

384
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,550
but do you ever use them?

385
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,980
I don't use them.

386
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,590
Then why do you bother?

387
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:37,920
Don't you blindly want goods from
your favorites when they come out?

388
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,860
As a fan, and as a collector.

389
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,060
I don't know, cards
that you never use?

390
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,360
You can't use it! You have
to safely stow it away.

391
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,530
When I see people carelessly
using them, it really pisses me off.

392
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,970
Items like this should never be used!

393
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,870
And auctioning or selling them off
is out of the question.

394
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,440
If you do, of course you fail as a fan,

395
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,310
but you also fail as a collector!

396
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,310
You say it so passionately, but...

397
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,950
In my case, I need
at least three cards.

398
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,950
One to keep for eternity,

399
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,190
and I safely stow it away
in a special case just for it.

400
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:13,260
And one to pull out and
look at every so often.

401
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,230
What about the third one?

402
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,990
- To spread the gospel.

403
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:15,330
- What's with that?
- To spread the gospel.

404
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:15,930
- What's with that?

405
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,200
When you really want something,

406
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,290
don't you want to have two
or three of them, Kagami?

407
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,940
Yeah, yeah, you don't.
Fine, I'm an otaku. I'm strange.

408
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:31,600
No, I vaguely understand
what you're trying to get at.

409
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,010
Tsukasa, you look like the type
that would be popular with boys,

410
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,680
but I never hear anything like that.

411
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,490
Tsukasa is a bit plain, and
she doesn't really stand out.

412
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,490
Yeah...

413
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,990
Maybe it's because a scary-looking
sister is always guarding her?

414
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,250
Did you say something?

415
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,630
I think it's not that I'm plain,

416
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,530
but more like Kona-chan and
Yuki-chan are very unique.

417
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:54,370
Miyuki-san really knows
a lot of stuff, and is pretty,

418
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,700
and has a nice figure, and really
wears glasses out of necessity,

419
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,600
- and hates dentists, and is clumsy,
and is a natural airhead...

420
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,400
- Hey now,
- and hates dentists, and is clumsy,
and is a natural airhead...

421
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,570
didn't that get a bit
strange in the middle?

422
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,640
But, come to think of it, there
aren't any rumors about Miyuki.

423
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,550
Maybe guys find it hard to approach
her because she's so pretty?

424
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,050
I don't think that's the case.

425
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:11,250
She's so nice, and
looks out for others so well.

426
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,520
You're right.

427
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,950
Maybe she's been asked out a lot.

428
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,560
But she's saying no?

429
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,090
She's saying no, huh...

430
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:21,090
Or when someone asks her out, she
doesn't realize she's being asked out.

431
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,660
That might be it.

432
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,700
Yuki-chan tends to be a bit dense,

433
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,030
so guys have to tell her in
a very straightforward way.

434
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:30,740
Really, the boys in your class
are all so irresponsible.

435
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,110
Doesn't somebody in there
have enough guts

436
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,970
to passionately state his feelings
and woo Miyuki?!

437
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,110
I don't think there is.

438
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:40,010
Maybe we don't have that many
maniac-types in our class.

439
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,180
A girl like Miyuki-san is

440
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,110
a little more geared
towards the maniac-types.

441
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,010
A maniac-type, huh...

442
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,720
Oh, it's already this late?

443
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,660
If you'll excuse me now...

444
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,690
Already?

445
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:59,300
Oh, please don't mind me,
and continue to relax.

446
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,100
Then, excuse me...

447
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,800
Yeah, see you later!

448
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,290
Laters!

449
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,560
And, there was more
to that story, and he...

450
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,610
Excuse me!

451
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,010
All right!

452
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,680
I'm sorry...

453
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,050
No, no, no...

454
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:23,020
It happens! I've done it before too.

455
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,460
I have too.

456
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,160
Everyone does it at least once.

457
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,190
You've done it too, right, Konata?

458
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,590
Nope.

459
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:33,130
In other words, that's
one part of her moe!

460
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,230
Miyuki-san...

461
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,130
Good job!

462
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,370
Lucky Star!

463
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,270
Lucky Channel!

464
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,370
Morning Luckies!

465
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:44,510
Yeah, today, we're starting
Lucky Channel again

466
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,750
with squeak-squeak-squeaky energy!

467
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,210
I'm Akira Kogami,
your navigator! And...

468
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:52,850
Well, I'm Minoru Shiraishi,
assistant to Akira-sama.

469
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:53,820
Nice to see you all.

470
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,790
Right, right...

471
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:59,760
It's already the third time that
the two of us have run the show!

472
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,530
What do you think, Shiraishi-san?
Have you gotten used to it yet?

473
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,290
No, not really... I'm sorry.

474
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,500
Well, it seems like you really haven't

475
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,340
opened up your heart
to me yet, Shiraishi-san...

476
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,210
It seems like you're sitting a bit
further away from me than usual.

477
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,400
Maybe this is the distance
between our hearts...

478
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,480
That's not the case, really...

479
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:23,550
Now, I'd like to start with
a twinkle again today!

480
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:27,220
Let's see... Today is a very
happy project for all fans!

481
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,220
Can you believe it?

482
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,310
The introduction of the Lucky Star
regular cast, first installment!

483
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:36,130
Yes. Today, we are introducing
Miss Miyuki Takara.

484
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:39,300
Let's see... Class committee chair,
beautiful appearance,

485
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,500
gentle-spirited, obviously intelligent...

486
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,670
That's "clearly intelligent".

487
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:43,670
Clearly,

488
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:46,270
good at literature and athletics,
a perfect superhuman...

489
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,340
Shiraishi-san, you know
a lot about Miyuki, right?

490
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,110
Oh, I know a lot about her!

491
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,780
Miyuki is very nice.

492
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,410
First off, those glasses!

493
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,250
And she's really pretty.

494
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,520
Usually, when someone
is that beautiful,

495
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,290
you get the feeling that you
shouldn't be going near her,

496
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,290
- but she turns out to be
very easygoing and friendly...

497
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,120
- Wow...
- but she turns out to be
very easygoing and friendly...

498
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,720
I wish you would talk
that much on the radio.

499
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,830
I see... Get you started on Miyuki,
and you can't stop.

500
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,300
Oh, no, it's nothing like that...

501
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,300
Well, yeah... Was it
Miss Miyuki Takara?

502
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,570
She's one of those
pretty-faced characters?

503
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:17,770
And she's got big breasts?

504
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,740
And even her faults just
make her more moe?

505
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,470
- I'm so jealous...
Those beauty-type pretty women

506
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,270
- Akira-sama, are you there?
- I'm so jealous...
Those beauty-type pretty women

507
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,940
are also liked by the
maniac-types too...

508
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,810
But when it comes to being
liked by the maniac-types,

509
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:27,780
well, I have all the pedo...

510
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,450
Oh, too bad!

511
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,320
It's time to say goodbye already!

512
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,650
And so, in this segment, we always
seek questions and praise for me,

513
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:39,220
as well as your opinions of the show,
so please send them!

514
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,330
Oh, then... Please look
forward to next time.

515
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,260
See you!

516
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,660
So what is she actually like?

517
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,300
She's just like how I described her.

518
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,430
You're kidding! She's not puffing out
white smoke from her nose

519
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,370
in the dressing room or something?

520
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,340
Oh, on that point she's fine,
she's not like you, Akira-sama.

521
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,310
I see.

522
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,780
That's amusing.

523
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,480
That was a unique song.

524
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,610
I'd like to hear a song that is
easy on ordinary people's ears.

525
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,270
You'll know the next song, Kagami.

526
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,750
Let's guess what it is from the intro!

527
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,780
I hope this isn't another strange song.

528
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,760
Oh? What was this?

529
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,930
I don't know...

530
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,660
And, Kagamin, what's the answer?

531
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,300
Oh, it's Full Metal!

532
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,420
Full Metal?

533
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,400
Furthermore, it's Kagami's
favorite, Fumoffu!

534
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,540
So that's it.

535
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,740
I just read the novel a bit,
and was only slightly hooked!
